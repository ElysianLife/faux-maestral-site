# faux-maestral-site

About:
Created in 2019
This project was part of my journey of learning HTML and CSS from scratch - including media queries and mobile-first principles; 
This was the first major website I hand-coded in HTML/CSS based on an existing website (Maestral), under the tutelage of my mentor from Victoria Tech Training. 

Files:
Fairly standard set-up: 
images in the image folder; 
index.html is the homepage; 
all css files in the css folder
